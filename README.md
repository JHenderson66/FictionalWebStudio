I have created a html webpage with multiple pages for a fictional web studio offering fictional web services. There are a total of 4 pages (Home, Pricing, Services, and Contact) and one CSS file. 
I started this small project just for practice and I'm finally happy with what I have come up with. I chose a web studio because I saw freelance devs offering services online and thought 
it would be a fun idea to make a website based on that.
